#Arduino 4x4 Keypad Test

## What is this?
This sketch uses `analogRead()` on 4 different Arduino analog input pins to determine which key was pressed from an 8-pin 4x4 keypad and sends a message with that character to the serial line. The setup assumes pull-down resistor and output line is on each of the **row pins** of the keypad and Vcc is on each of the **column pins**.
